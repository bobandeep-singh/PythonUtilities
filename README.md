# PythonUtilities
I'm creating this repository to keep all my python utility scripts at one place.

## Script: RenameAndSortFiles.py
Using this utility, I'm renaming all the files whose name is in the following format:
FileName #3.pfd, or File Name - abc #2.mp4

These files will get renamed to 03-FileName.pdf and 02-FileName-abc.mp4
